## _Meanbuy(Clone)_

Project: Cloning [Meanbuy](https://www.meanbuy.com/) site.

MeanBuy was originally founded as a cross border B2C e-commerce platform, . It primarily focuses on bringing transparency to customers ordering directly from wholesalers or manufacturers. By offering flexible pricing around future delivery dates. MeanBuy was able to offer the customer a unique shopping experience, while still being able to exactly know when products would arrive. Our pricing algorithm made life easier for end-consumers and sellers!

In this project I tried to utilize our learning outcomes of all unit Full Stack Web Development course at Masai School. With our best efforts,I tried to clone the whole website replicating same UI and functionality as of the original with few changes.

## How To Run The Project
1. First click on https://meanbuy-clone-alpha.vercel.app/ to reach the home page where you can see the navbar footer and the body of homepage, Navbar is Provided with many routes and links and it also has a cart link that is a protected route, so without logging in user cannot open that cart page.
2. Then after checking cart link user will be redirected to the login page because of protected route and then he has to login in order to see the cart page.
3. User can manually signup and login as there is a link provided for login and signup but do keep in mind that I have used json-server, so the email and password of login should be according to json-server for eg:-(email:-eve.holt@reqres.in) & (password:- cityslicka). And then user gets logged in after successful authentication.
4. So in the categories section there are many list of items where user can filter and sort and then he can add the product to the cart and then he can visit the cart and from there he can delete items from the cart and then he can proceed to checkout page.
5. In checkout page, user has to fill all the contact details and there he can set the promocode also. If a person enters "meanbuy30" he gets 30% discount.
6. So after that user can proceed to payment page where he can enter the otp which is already set to "1234". Then atlast he sees the thanks page.

## End Notes ðŸ§¾
In this project I tried to the best of our ability to replicate all the functionality and also nearly complete UI of the site. This was a great learning curve as initially it seemed imposible to acheive the objective but with time as I kept on learning new tools and technique during construct week I finally tasted the success in completing the project.

## Limitations
Due to time constraint, I was able to make only one watches page which has all the crud functionalties.
